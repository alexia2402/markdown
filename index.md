# My Story

## To start off...

I am a Future Army Soldier and a student at Franklin D. Roosevelt High School. For the past two, almost three years, I’m an enrolled student in the collegiate academy. I’m the type of person that loves to do workouts for fun. But mostly, to enhance my combat and reaction abilities.  I shall fight beyond this wretched world of malevolence. Sometimes, I’m the type of person that does not dislike the purpose of studies. For it helps increase your knowledge by keeping them imprisoned in the asylum of my mind

## My Fabulous Mission

I was sent here on an earthly investigation by the secret alien association 935. They are considered to be the most FEARED vicious reptilian panda breed in Outer space. They, my boss, gave me a human costume -disgusting- to disguise myself among these bags of rotten flesh. Even though it’s really stuffy in my assigned donated human skin, the disguise is really working. As always, I successfully found the secret of the reason as to why these “students” have a miserable life. These high school students have free education and they graduate with their ASSOCIATE’S degree. I wonder as to why would these young humans choose a miserable life running away in the away from debts inviting arms?
