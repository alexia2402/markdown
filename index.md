# To start off...

I am a Future Army Soldier and a student at Franklin D. Roosevelt High School. For the past two, almost three years, I’m an enrolled student in the collegiate academy. I’m the type of person that loves to do workouts for fun. But mostly, to enhance my combat and reaction abilities.  I shall fight beyond this wretched world of malevolence. Sometimes, I’m the type of person that does not dislike the purpose of studies. For it helps increase your knowledge by keeping them imprisoned in the asylum of my mind
